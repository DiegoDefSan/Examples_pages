                <p>
                    Alfred Nobel was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist and businessman who also 
                    wrote poetry and drama. His varied interests are reflected in the prize he 
                    established and which he lay the foundation for in 1895 when he wrote his last will, 
                    leaving much of his wealth to the establishment of the prize.

                    Since 1901, the Nobel Prize has been honoring men and women from around the world 
                    for outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, 
                    literature and for work in peace.

                    According to his will and testament read in Stockholm on 30 December 1896, a foundation 
                    established by Alfred Nobel would reward those who serve humanity. The Nobel Prize was 
                    funded by Alfred Nobel's personal fortune. According to the official sources, Alfred Nobel 
                    bequeathed 94% of his fortune to the Nobel Foundation that now forms the economic base of 
                    the Nobel Prize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organization on 29 June 1900. Its function is 
                    to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. In accordance with Nobel's will, 
                    the primary task of the foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left. Robert and Ludvig Nobel 
                    were involved in the oil business in Azerbaijan, and according to Swedish historian E. Bargengren, 
                    who accessed the Nobel family archive, it was this "decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money 
                    from Baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established". 
                    Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to 
                    oversee informal administration related to the prizes. The foundation is not involved in the process 
                    of selecting the Nobel laureates. In many ways, the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment 
                    company, in that it invests Nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the 
                    administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden (since 1946) 
                    and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953). Since the 1980s, the foundation's 
                    investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007, the assets controlled by the 
                    Nobel Foundation amounted to 3.628 billion Swedish kronor (c. US$560 million).

                <p>
                    According to the statutes, the foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, 
                    with its seat in Stockholm. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council, 
                    with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions. An Executive 
                    Director is chosen from among the board members, a deputy director is appointed by the King in Council, 
                    and two deputies are appointed by the trustees. However, since 1995, all the members of the board have 
                    been chosen by the trustees, and the executive director and the deputy director appointed by the board 
                    itself. As well as the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the 
                    Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and 
                    the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of these institutions, and auditors.

                        <p>
                            Physics was the prize area which Alfred Nobel mentioned first in his will from 1895. 
                            At the end of the nineteenth century, many people considered physics as the foremost 
                            of the sciences, and perhaps Nobel saw it this way as well. His own research was also 
                            closely tied to physics.

                        <p>
                            Chemistry was the most important science for Alfred Nobel’s own work. The development 
                            of his inventions as well as the industrial processes he employed were based upon 
                            chemical knowledge. Chemistry was the second prize area that Nobel mentioned in his will.

                        <p>
                            Alfred Nobel had an active interest in medical research. Through Karolinska Institutet, 
                            he came into contact with Swedish physiologist Jöns Johansson around 1890. Johansson worked 
                            in Nobel’s laboratory in Sevran, France during a brief period the same year. Physiology 
                            or medicine was the third prize area Nobel mentioned in his will.

                    <li class="pr">Literature prize
                        <p>
                            Alfred Nobel had broad cultural interests. During his early youth, he developed his literary 
                            interests which lasted throughout his life. His library consisted of a rich and broad selection 
                            of literature in different languages. During the last years of his life, he tried his hand as 
                            an author and began writing fiction. Literature was the fourth prize area Nobel mentioned in his 
                            will.

                        <p>
                            Alfred Nobel showed a big interest in social issues and was engaged in the peace movement. 
                            His acquaintance with Bertha von Suttner, who was a driving force in the international peace 
                            movement in Europe and later awarded the Peace Prize, influenced his views on peace. Peace was 
                            the fifth and final prize area that Nobel mentioned in his will. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded 
                            by a committee elected by the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget).

                        <p>
                            In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established the Prize in Economic Sciences in 
                            Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. The Prize is based on a donation received by 
                            the Nobel Foundation in 1968 from Sveriges Riksbank on the occasion of the Bank’s 300th 
                            anniversary. The first Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen 
                            in 1969.
